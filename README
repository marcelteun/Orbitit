With this program you can interactively investigate some polyhedra. I use this
program myself and I am willing to share it with other who are interested. I use
Ubuntu, as a consequence some problems might exist with windows.

WXPYTHON
========

When wsPython is installed through pip it is compiled. This can take quite some
time (e.g. more than 15 minutes). This means that there should be c-compiler
available at least. For a Debian Linux you would need have installed (e.g.
through apt-get) the packages
 - build-essential
 - libgtk-3-dev and libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev (or whathever GTK version you are using)
 - python3-dev
 - libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa

The reason for me to choose wxPython over Tk was that I ran into quite some
preformance problems with Tk. The disadvantage is that it can be a pain to
install wxPython through pip.

IF YOU DOWNLOADED THIS FROM GITHUB DIRECTLY
===========================================

Requirements
------------
You will need:
1. python 3.x:  http://www.python.org
2. wxPython: http://www.wxpython.org
3. pyOpenGL: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/

Install
-------
E.g. for Ubuntu or other Debian based Linux dist:
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

Then use pip to install other packages, e.g:
    pip3 install pyopengl wxpython

See "WXPYTHON" above for more about installing wxPython through pip.

Run
---
Make sure the PYTHONPATH points out this directory, e.g.
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD

Also make sure to have set the PYOPENGL_PLATFORM environment variable.
On my system I do
    source init_env
    python orbitit

INSTALLING THROUGH "PIP INSTALL ORBITIT"
========================================

Alse here it is important to have the correct packages for building wxPython
installed. See "WXPYTHON" above.

Install
-------
pip install orbitit

Run
---
python -m orbitit

ERRORS
======

1.
If you get problems with a context not being valid, e.g.
OpenGL.error.Error: Attempt to retrieve context when no valid context

Then this might be related to eht wrong PYOPENGL_PLATFORM
In my case this problem was solved by

PYOPENGL_PLATFORM=egl python -m orbitit

2.
If you get problems with NotImplementedError on GLCanvas you probably built
wxPython without the wxgtk support. See WXPYTHON above.

SEGMENTATION FAULTS
===================

Ig you get a segmentation fault, make sure that you have a python with debug
symbols. Then in the Orbitit directory exevute the following:
$ gdb python
...
(gdb) run
...
>>> import Orbitit

Then do your stuff to recreate the segmentation fault.
E.g. you might see the following:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x024303aa in ?? () from /usr/lib/nvidia-xxx/libGLcore.so.1

Then the crash was caused your nvidia-xxx driver.
