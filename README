With this program you can interactively investigate some polyhedra. I use this
program myself and I am willing to share it with other who are interested. I use
Ubuntu, as a consequence some problems might exist with windows.

If you downloaded this from github directly:

Requirements:
-------------
You will need:
1. Python 3.x:  http://www.python.org
2. Wxpython: http://www.wxpython.org
3. pyOpenGL: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/

E.g. for Ubuntu or other Debian based Linux dist:
----------------
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

Then use pip to install other packages, e.g:
    pip3 install pyopengl wxpython

Note installing wxpython can take quite while

Run:
----
Make sure the PYTHONPATH points out this directory, e.g.
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
then
python orbitit/Orbitit.py

If you have installed this through "pip install orbitit"
Run:
python -m orbitit

Segmentation Faults:
--------------------

Ig you get a segmentation fault, make sure that you have a python with debug
symbols. Then in the Orbitit directory exevute the following:
$ gdb python
...
(gdb) run
...
>>> import Orbitit

Then do your stuff to recreate the segmentation fault.
E.g. you might see the following:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x024303aa in ?? () from /usr/lib/nvidia-xxx/libGLcore.so.1

Then the crash was caused your nvidia-xxx driver.
