	Perhaps precision should be interpreted/written for floating point
	numbers, instead of writing the nrs in a classical way.

	2012-09-22
	You could ass searched for A4 for strip I - twisted - strip I. This
	should lead to folded heptagons. Just adding the possibility just leads
	to nonsense.

	2012-04-01
	search shell:
		add options: e.g. iterations, nr of threads, symmetry, etc
		search all
		set iterations to 10,000
		etc

	When frh-roots-1_1_1_1-fld_parallel.0-alt_rot_strip_1_loose.py is looded
	into Orbitit it doesn't set the right triangle fill

	Why are these generated? What are these anyway?

	In RandFindMultiRootOnDomain.run you set maxIter in the loop depending
	on the amount of solutions. It is a pity this happens in the loop.
	Perhaps a constant would be better. It would be interesting to know to
	see what the min, max and avg iter value is for a converged set up.
	It seems these high maxes aren't reached anyway. Perhaps the max_iter
	should increase depending on the precision.

PRIO
2012-09-19 - Heptagons Scene: there is a shell fill that is the opposite of the
             current one. I.e. the origin is opposite. Note that for a W-fold
	     and a trapezium fold this doesn't make much sense...

2012-03-08 - 2 Implement a float slider with support for set

2012-03-01 - 2 fix empty OFF file read

2012-03-03 - 16:28 simplified print to PS from orbit scene.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a float slider with support for set. Use Scene_Orbit as an example.

2012-03-01 - 2
fix empty OFF file read: make error message more readable than now.

test:
	2012-03-05 0:45
	Add some performance test, with a limit.

	2012-03-05 0:46
	Split test, so you can run them separately?

Orbitit - Geom3D:
	2012-03-03 - 16:28
	THe orbit scene creates compounds of symmetric shapes now, so output to
	PS checks all the faces again, while only the faces from the base shape
	are needed. Fix this. First and mainly for compounds of 1 shape.

Orbitit:
	2012-02-12
	Add view settings: list all faces by length and choose colour
	These nrs can be used for exporting to PS: only export...

	2012-02-14 - 2
	Enable start Orbitit with a specified scene
	Open any python scene through File -> Open menu (call it plug-in?)

	2012-02-14 - 3
	Open / Import python files

	2012-03-01 - 4
	add command line parameters for auto test.

	2012-02-14 - 4
	handle pentagrams: in export to PS, it should be one edge. Perhaps you
	should have them as pentagrams with 5 edges and handle the 3D stuff...
	That will help for the new scene as well.

equilateral heptagons:

Scenes:
	2012-02-27
	Move the fancy logging from '1c56863 orbit: add fancy logging' to the
	general scenes file (from Scene_Orbit.py).

Geom3D:
	2012-03-03 - 16:33
	The cleaned up shape could destroy the colours if faces are deleted.

	2012-02-11
	export to PS: print faces that ly in the same plane on top of each other

	2012-02-11
	export to PS: show lines with problem with different colour

	2012-03-01 - 3
	extra info in toOffStr file: angles aren't merged that should have after
	rounding.

Scene_Orbit:
	2012-05-06:
		TODO: add GUI support for special mu_s:
			- add special mu (button)
			- reset special angles (button)
		ERROR: assertion error for data/cubeCompounds/c_3B_D3xI_C2xI.py
			even while setting up Dn (n=3) with std settings and
			stabliliser E. It seems there is a wrong subgroup.
	2012-02-26:
		TODO set angle by copy paste
		TODO fix the following orbit test: apply, rotate, then colour:
			no rotation
		TODO cannot handle compound of isometric shapes:
			in CompoundShape.set_shapes:
				shape.gl.force_set_vs = True

	2012-02-26
	Create a rotate arount axis widget, which can be used by the orbit scene
